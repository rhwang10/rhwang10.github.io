  <div class="aboutme__background">
    <p>I am a software engineer at Astronomer, and have been working in the Cincinnati
      office since August 2018. I work across the stack, implementing and testing
      platform features that enable organizations to easily adapt and productionize Apache
      Airflow into their own data ecosystems. Some of the incredible open source technologies that I've had the 
      opportunity to work with include Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd,
      ElasticSearch and Kibana.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a
      minor in Biology. I am a 2018 Venture for America Fellow, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research Grant
      recipient, and Sigma Xi Research society member. I enjoy constantly challenging myself
      to improve my skills as an engineer, as well as staying up to date with
      the latest best practices and releases.</p>
